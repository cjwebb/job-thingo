<p>Recruitment is hard. Firstly, there's the job ads, then the rounds of interviews, and ultimately it's all down to a final gamble on whether the relationship flourishes.
<br/><br/>
JobThing wants to take some of that gamble out of the game.<br/><br/>

Like any gamble, the odds are improved when more factors can be taken as 'known'. This is one reason why endorsements and recommendations go a long way in the recruitment game. Imagine if your own recommendation network could easily be expanded to include your trusted circle of contacts. <br/><br/>

This is where JobThing enters the game. <br/><br/>

Share Opportunities. Share recommendations.<br/>
Share your network and reap the rewards.<br/><br/>

JobThing is a platform to share opportunities across professional social networks. It allows ads to be shared between network members and referral fees to be split and spread.<br/><br/>

Recruitment is hard. Let JobThing make it a little easier.
